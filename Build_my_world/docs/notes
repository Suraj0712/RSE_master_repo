gazebo:
Model editor
-> edit -> model editor
-> drag and drop the shapes
-> double click link inspector tab
-> link -> for objects pose in world
-> visual and collision -> for objects shape and properties
-> make sure you finalise the model before exiting as for editing you have to do that in .sdf file
-> to connect the joints use joints tab align the object as per your need

Building editor
-> edit -> building editor
-> use wall to draw outlines. you can chage the dimention of individual element independently.

-> then load the same world add the models and buildings
-> save it again

Gazebo plug in
create the script file as one in the directory
create CMakeLists.txt 
-> make sure you have correct executable and .cpp file name

building the project
$ cd /home/workspace/myrobot
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ../
$ make # You might get errors if your system is not up to date!
$ export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:/home/workspace/myrobot/build

the export step is important here

add the plugin in the world file
-> open world file and search for <world name='default'>
below that add following line
<plugin name="hello" filename="libhello.so"/>
-> in above line replace hello with the name of executive
